#Issues for the commandline

Issues need to be simpler, especially for two or three people projects.

So, Cronk is a command line based issue "system".

```sh
cronk --add "Man, you gotta fix this"

cronk --show

cronk --remove 5
```

Or, for short:

```sh
cronk -a "You really should fix this"

cronk -s

cronk -r 2
```

That is all.
